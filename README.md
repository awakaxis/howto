# HowTo CLI  
  
Ever been straight up terminal'in, wanting to do something specific but you forgot which command fits the job? Maybe it's 5 AM and you've been programming for 12 hours, so you really just cant be arsed to think about how to use your commands.  
  
## The problem:  
It's just SO much work opening ChatGPT or whatever chatbot service in a browser, always having to look from my terminal to the other monitor and back *just* to ask a quick question. Or even worse, SEARCHING the interwebs for something so simple. But then I was all like,  
  
## What if you could do that in the terminal??  
The answer? Simply ask your AI Overlords how to do the job (but in the terminal this time). With a simple `howto`, I **guarantee** anything--and I mean *anything*[^1]--can be solved in an instant.  
  
## "How?" you might ask, do you use this wonderful tool?  
It's really quite easy, just put this program somewhere on your file system, create an alias to it for easy access, and put your OpenAI API key in your environment variables. Then, you're all set to receive only the *finest* hallucinated misinformation while simultaneously burning a hole in your pockets!
